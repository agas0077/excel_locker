# Excel Locker
> This is a little app that sets passwords to your excel files.

It takes a banch of your excel files and applies a macro script to each of them. 
The macro opens each file sets password and resaves the file.

That is what you get as a result.

## Additional info

This is a first version of the app. I needed it for work, so I spent very little time on it. However, as I need to use it on a daily basis, I plan to work on its development.

If you find this app usefull for your business, feel free to take, use and work on it.

NOTE: I'm a novice to python dev, so don't blame me for mistakes or some bad practices. I would really appriciate any reasonable comments =)
